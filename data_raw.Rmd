## Load LTER data
Import loop courtesy of Allison Horst:
```{r}
# Create a list of file names you want to read in
knb_files <- list.files(here("knb-lter-groupdata"), pattern = "*.csv")
# Loop over the files, reading in and creating a stored object with 'assign()'. See ?assign for more information.
# stringr::str_remove() simplifies the file names
# by removing both the 55_pp52_ and the .csv that start / end all file names
# See ?assign for more information
for (i in seq_along(knb_files)) {
  assign(knb_files[i] %>% 
           str_remove(".csv"), 
         read_csv(here("knb-lter-groupdata", 
                       knb_files[i])))
}
```


This file is just for reference, showing a personalized way to load the raw data into R to begin wrangling.

In the interest of time for this project, we are using the researcher's own wrangling code from https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/codeGeneration?packageId=knb-lter-luq.20.4923052&statisticalFileType=tidyr
